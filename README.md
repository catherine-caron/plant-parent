# plant-parent
Plant Parent is an app to help you take care of your plants! This is a capstone project by Catherine and Rajaa! 

This Android Application is built with SpringTool, Heroku and Android Studio. Currently it is possible to view part of the UI using Android Studio Preview Features. Since the backend has still some changes to be done and hasn't been linked to the UI yet, it is currently only possible to view the code and not execute it yet. This will likely happen in the week of March 14th. To execute the backend when it is fully functioning, a Heroku URL containing the backend methods will be linked to the Android application and all will be launched when the application is started. A reminders function is being implemented and tested currently. 

Issues as well as the Wiki are kept in their respective section on github.
